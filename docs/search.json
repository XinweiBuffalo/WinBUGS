    "text": "The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) is a project on developing software for the Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The project started in 1989 at the MRC Biostatistics Unit. WinBUGS is a statistical software based on BUGS project initially released in 1997 by MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Imperial College School of Medicine. It is a GUI for using BUGS program on Windows system. WinBUGS is no longer update since 2007 because the development of OpenBUGS. The latest version of WinBUGS is 1.4.3.\n\n\n\nDownload WinBUGS 1.4.3 on your PC:\n\n.zip file for Windows 64 bit or 32 bit. (Recommended)\n.exe file for easier installation but 32 bit Windows only.\nfor macOS.\n\nExtract file folder \\winbugs143_unrestricted.zip\\winbugs14_full_patched\\WinBUGS14 to a path that you want to store the software, for example C:\\Program Files.\nCreate a shortcut for WinBUGS14.exe to desktop or start.\n\n\n\n\nConsider a statistical model \\[\nX_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\n\\] and given the prior distributions \\(\\mu \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 100^2)\\) and \\(1 / {\\sigma}^2 \\sim \\text{Gamma}(0.001, 0.001)\\).\nA WinBUGS program is consist of three sections: Model, Data, and Initial Values. Define our model in model{...}. Use ~ to specify probability distributions, or use <- to make transformation of parameter and data. Data will be stored in a list which has the same syntax as R. Initial values are also stored in a list.\n```{bugs}\n\nmodel{\n  for (i in 1:20){\n    x[i] ~ dnorm (mu[1], prec[1])\n  }\n  \n  mu[1] ~ dnorm (0, 0.0001)\n  prec[1] ~ dgamma (0.001, 0.001)\n  \n  s2[1] <- 1/prec[1]\n}\n\nlist(x = c(6.62, 6.71, 5.07, 4.39, 5.68, 3.94, 5.83, 2.31, 3.60, 4.64,\n1.79, 3.12, 3.46, 8.25, 5.49, 6.49, 2.65, 9.14, 5.31, 6.58))\n\nlist( mu=c(0), prec=c(1) )\n```\nNote: In BUGS, the second parameter of dnorm is the inverse of normal variance.\nNow let’s see how to run these codes in WinBUGS. Open WinBUGS and create an empty script (File -> New). \nCopy the above code and paste them into WinBUGS. \nOpen the Specification Tool (Model -> Specification), then highlight the model section and do “check model”. If you define your model correctly, it will show “model is syntactically correct.” at the bottom left-hand corner. \nThe next step is to load the data. Highlight data section () and click “load data”. You will see “data loaded”at the bottom left-hand corner. \nAnd then compile the model by click “compile” and look for “model compiled.” \nSimilarly, highlight the initial values and click “load inits”. \nOpen Sample Monitor Tool (Inference -> Samples), type in the parameters that we are going to monitor, for example “mu” and “s2”, then click “set”. \nOpen Update Tool (Model -> Update) and type in how many samples you would like to generate. Click “update” and wait for “updates took x s” message when update done. \nYou can use Sample Monitor Tool to do summary statistics, time series plot for MCMC samples, density curve, etc."

    "text": "School data example\nThe Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) data comes from the SAT-V (Verbal) on eight different high schools, from an experiment conducted in the late 1970s. SAT-V is a standard multiple choice test administered by the Educational Testing Service. This Service was interested in the effects of coaching programs for each of the selected schools. The study included coached and uncoached pupils, about sixty in each of the eight different schools; see Rubin (1981). All of them had already taken the PSAT (Preliminary SAT) which results were used as covariates. For each school, the estimated treatment effect and the standard error of the effect estimate are given. These are calculated by an analysis of covariance adjustment appropriate for a completely randomized experiment (Rubin 1981). This example was analyzed using a hierarchical normal model in Rubin (1981) and Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin (2003, Section 5.5).\n\ndata(schools)\nschools\n\n  school estimate   sd\n1      A    28.39 14.9\n2      B     7.94 10.2\n3      C    -2.75 16.3\n4      D     6.82 11.0\n5      E    -0.64  9.4\n6      F     0.63 11.4\n7      G    18.01 10.4\n8      H    12.16 17.6\n\n\n\nmod1 <- \"model {\n  for (j in 1:J)\n  {\n    y[j] ~ dnorm (theta[j], tau.y[j])\n    theta[j] ~ dnorm (mu.theta, tau.theta)\n    tau.y[j] <- pow(sigma.y[j], -2)\n  }\n  mu.theta ~ dnorm (0.0, 1.0E-6)\n  tau.theta <- pow(sigma.theta, -2)\n  sigma.theta ~ dunif (0, 1000)\n}\"\nwriteLines(mod1, \"/path/to/model/mod1.bug\")\n\n\nJ <- nrow(schools)\ny <- schools$estimate\nsigma.y <- schools$sd\ndata <- list (\"J\", \"y\", \"sigma.y\")\n\n\nBuilding model\n\n\nMCMC\n\n\nInference on the MC samples"
