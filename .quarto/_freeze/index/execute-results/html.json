The project started in 1989 at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/){target=\"_blank\"}. WinBUGS is a  statistical software based on BUGS project initially released in 1997 by MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Imperial College School of Medicine. It is a GUI for using BUGS program on Windows system. WinBUGS is no longer update since 2007 because the development of OpenBUGS. The latest version of WinBUGS is 1.4.3. \n\n## Installation of  WinBUGS 1.4.3\n\nFirst, download WinBUGS 1.4.3 on your PC:  \n* Recommended [.zip file](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/winbugs143_unrestricted.zip){target=\"_blank\"}  for Windows 64 bit or 32 bit. \n* [.exe file](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS14.exe){target=\"_blank\"} for easier installation but 32 bit Windows only.\n* for macOS.  \n\nExtract file folder `\\winbugs143_unrestricted.zip\\winbugs14_full_patched\\WinBUGS14` to a path that you want to store the software, for example `C:\\Program Files`.\n\n\n\n123\n\n##  \n\nThis is a Quarto website.\n\nTo learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n# The R interface of WinBUGS: R2WinBUGS\n123\n\n## Install R2WinBUGS package\n123\n\n## Example\n123\n\n### Building model\n123\n\n### MCMC\n123\n\n### Inference on the MC samples\n1234\n\n\n\n\n",
