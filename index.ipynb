        "The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) is a project on developing software for the Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The project started in 1989 at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/){target=\"_blank\"}. WinBUGS is a statistical software based on BUGS project initially released in 1997 by MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Imperial College School of Medicine. It is a GUI for using BUGS program on Windows system. WinBUGS is no longer update since 2007 because the development of OpenBUGS. The latest version of WinBUGS is 1.4.3.\n",
