# Getting start with WinBUGS

The BUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) is a project on developing software for the Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The project started in 1989 at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/){target="_blank"}. WinBUGS is a statistical software based on BUGS project initially released in 1997 by MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Imperial College School of Medicine. It is a GUI for using BUGS program on Windows system. WinBUGS is no longer update since 2007 because the development of OpenBUGS. The latest version of WinBUGS is 1.4.3.

## Installation of WinBUGS 1.4.3

1.  First, download WinBUGS 1.4.3 on your PC:\
    [.zip file](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/winbugs143_unrestricted.zip){target="_blank"} for Windows 64 bit or 32 bit. (Recommended)

[.exe file](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/WinBUGS14.exe){target="_blank"} for easier installation but 32 bit Windows only.

for macOS.

2.  Extract file folder `\winbugs143_unrestricted.zip\winbugs14_full_patched\WinBUGS14` to a path that you want to store the software, for example `C:\Program Files`.

3.  Create a shortcut for `WinBUGS14.exe` to desktop or start.

## Example of using WinBUGS

Consider a statistical model $$
X_i \sim \text{Normal}(\mu,\sigma^2)
$$ and given the prior distributions $\mu \sim \text{Normal}(0, 100^2)$ and $1 / {\sigma}^2 \sim \text{Gamma}(0.001, 0.001)$.

``` {{bugs}}

model{
  for (i in 1:20){
    x[i] ~ dnorm (mu[1], prec[1])
  }
  
  mu[1] ~ dnorm (0, 0.0001)
  prec[1] ~ dgamma (0.001, 0.001)
  
  s2[1] <- 1/prec[1]
}

list(x = c(6.62, 6.71, 5.07, 4.39, 5.68, 3.94, 5.83, 2.31, 3.60, 4.64,
1.79, 3.12, 3.46, 8.25, 5.49, 6.49, 2.65, 9.14, 5.31, 6.58))

list( mu=c(0), prec=c(1))

```
Note: In BUGS, the second parameter of `dnorm` is the inverse of normal variance.
